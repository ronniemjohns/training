<!-- 3 different ways of styling, and they can overwrite each other (lower # below has higher precedence)
1. Inline Styles - write CSS in the element tag within the HTML file
2. Internal Styles - embedded in the head section as a <style> element within the HTML file
3. external style sheet - external file - best method, USUALLY in the head section (in a link element)
